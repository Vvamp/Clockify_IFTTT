## Description

This project simply uses the C# Clockify API wrapper to create a weblistener, which controls clockify.
This was made for a personal project, but it was released as I believe it's quite fun to fool around with.

## Installation

### Prerequisits

You will need the following: - .NET SDK 5.0.0 or higher - .NET Runtime 5.0.0 or higher

### Install

Simply clone this repository.

- To build: run `dotnet build`
- To actually run, either run the executable. Or run `dotnet run <api-key>`. Make sure to substitute the '<api-key>', with your [clockify api key](https://clockify.me/user/settings).
